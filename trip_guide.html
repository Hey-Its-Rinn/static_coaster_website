        <h2>Trip Guide</h2>
        <p>
          I have some tips that I think will help anyone thinking about visiting
          a theme park.
        </p>
        <h3>Before you go</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Buy your tickets online - they are always cheaper online and you can
            skip the purchase line at the gate.
          </li>
          <li>
            If the park you are visiting is far and it's not likely you'll be
            back for a while, consider the fast lane offering if there are any.
            They can be expensive, but unless you plan on a few days at the
            park, sometimes it's the only way to get on every ride during your
            visit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Check the weather to be aware, but unless you see a full day of
            thunderstroms in the morning forecast, don't rush to cancelling your
            trip. A little rain in the forecast can actually mean the park won't
            be that busy, but some rides may close for even a drop. Others will
            remain completely open as long as there is no hail, excessive wind,
            or lightning. If you don't mind a little rain it can work out.
            Thunderstorms can be unpredictable. Sometimes there is rain when
            none is forecasted and sometimes it's clear skies when it said there
            would be rain. If you have a lot of flexibility on when you visit,
            then go when the weather will be clear but depending on if you have
            friends or family joining you, that only have this day set aside,
            you might have to stick to a schedule.
          </li>
          <li>
            Plan how you will carry your belongings. Use a small waist pack to
            carry the few things you do bring. Alternatively, make sure you have
            pockets that close very securely with some kind of fastener, making
            sure things can't slip out. Do not wear hats on roller coasters. if
            you plan on wearing glasses, have a snug lanyard or be mindful to
            only face forward. If you know a ride has a lot of "ejector"
            airtime, or inverted "hangtime" seriously consider not bringing
            glasses on at all or anythying you don't want to lose.
          </li>
          <li>
            Pack good sunscreen. A small tube is easier to carry than a large
            spray can.
          </li>
          <li>
            If it's more than a few hours to travel to the park, consider
            getting a hotel the nght before your visit so you are not tired when
            you are trying to enjoy yourself.
          </li>
          <li>
            Take a look at the park map before you go if you've never been there
            before. You'll be able to get around a lot better than trying to
            figure it out then.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Day of your trip</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Eat a big, harty breakfast. Obviosuly not immediately before riding
            a coaster, but if you eat before you go, you won't be looking for a
            meal the minute you walk in and you'll save a bit because food will
            be quite expensive inside the park.
          </li>
          <li>
            Be there early. Try to be there well before the park actually opens
            so you can maximize your time. Typically the earlier you arrive, the
            further inside the park you'll be waiting before they open the gates
            or remove the ropes, or remove whatever crowd control system they
            are using.
          </li>
          <li>
            In general, try to carry as little as possible. For example, just
            take your car key if you drove, not the whole key ring. Take things
            out of your wallet you don't need for the trip in case you lose it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Have a plan for which rides you want to go on first. Avoid the rides
            near the front of the park in the morning because the rides in the
            back of the park will have shorter lines for longer. For example,
            rides like Gatekeeper at Cedar Point are huge and exciting and you
            can see it from outside the park. For those reasons, the lines for
            that ride are almost guarenteed to be long. However you can likely
            hit 2 or 3 of the coasters in the back of the park by the time the
            park fills in with people.
          </li>
          <li>
            Some rides have very strict loose article policies, and even a waist
            pack isn't allowed on. In these cases, there are usually lockers for
            that ride and they sometimes cost a few dollars to use. In some
            parks your locker rental can move around with your from ride to
            ride, but you have to remember to move your things. Some rides at
            some parks will let you keep items at the station, but the security
            from theft is not as good as lockers so use them at your own risk.
