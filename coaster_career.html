                <h2>Rinn's Coaster Career</h2>
                <p>It all started when I was around 8 or 9 years old when I was playing one of my first video games on my dad's PC: Roller Coaster Tycoon. I spent so many hours in that game and its sequels designing parks and rides. It wasn't until I was in high school that I actually made my way to my first amusement park as part of a family vacation. We visited Holiday World in Santa Claus, IN. There I rode my first roller coaster, The Raven. I very soon after rode the other coasters in the park, The Legend and The Voyage. Needless to say, I was hooked.</p>

                <p>I found the roller coaster fan club, Theme Park Review online. Their site hosted an amazing collection of trip albums as well as park and coaster indexes. Of course there were the forums, which were great for just reading up about the state of parks and new rides under construction. I had the previlege of joining the group on a couple of tours in 2009 and 2010. This is when I got the majority of my "credits" (a credit is just a unique coaster ridden). We visited around a dozen parks on each trip. </p>
