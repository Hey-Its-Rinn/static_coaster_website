        <h2>Manufacturers</h2>

        <p>
          There are many different manufacturers of rides. I have decided to
          share a couple of my personal favorite manufacturers.
        </p>

        <h3>Great Coasters International</h3>
        <p>
          Great Coasters International has built many wooden roller coasters
          that are popular among enthusiansts. Distinguisiong characteristics of
          a GCI Coaster are smooth transitions between elements with very little
          straight track. Some of their rides, like El Toro, are built with
          pre-fabricated track that are precision-built in their factory and
          bolted together on-site. The result is a remarkably smooth ride (for a
          wooden coaster) that whips around a twisted layout. Finally, their
          single-bench train cars make the ride even more comfortable for riders
          as the vehicles are able to effortly negotiate the coumpound banks,
          dips, and turns without issue. Many GCI coasters give a similar ride.

        <h3>Bollinger & Mabillard</h3>
        <p>
          Bollinger & Mabillard, or simply B&M, sports an iconic box-beam steel
          track design. They have many different formats of coasters, and each
          gives a different ride.
        </p>

        <p>
          B&M manufactures a number of different formats. Here are descriptions
          of a few:
        </p>
        <details>
          <summary>Inverted</summary>
          The ride vehicle hangs below the track. Inverted layouts are often
          filled with inversions (moments were riders are upside-down). A ride
          on an Inverted B&M coaseter is usually very intense. Banchee is a
          example of an inverted coaster.

        </details>

        <details>
          <summary>Wing Coaster</summary>
          The ride vehicle is much wider than the track, with riders sitting on
          the "wings" of the vehicle on either side of track. A ride on a Wing
          coaster is less intense because the elements tend to be slower and
          drawn-out resulting is lower forces. What makes it stand out is the
          uniqueness of the ride, such as having nothing below or above the
          riders, giving a view not found on other ride formats. Typically there
          are elements where the ride will pass though a structure through a
          rectangular window. Riders will feel like they are narrowly flying
          through these structures and can experience "headchoppers" and
          "footchoppers" simultaneously. Gatekeeper at Cedar Point is a perfect
          example of a Wing coaster.

        <details>
          <summary>Hyper/Mega</summary>
          The terms "hyper" and "mega" tend to be used interchangeably and
          simply indicate a coaster that is taller than 200ft. These rides are
          very good at long, sustained moments of airtime due to their tall
          hills. They are often both the tallest and fastest roller coaster at
          the parks they are installed at. They typically have no inversions.
